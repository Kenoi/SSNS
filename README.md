# Shared Storage Computing System
A system which uses a shared storage area to carry out calculations using multiple computers.
Using a control file the program can be launched simultaneously on a set of computers. This is useful for mathmatically repetetive tasks such as finding prime numbers. The individual computers are assigned blocks of 1000 numbers which (in the case of prime number generation) are checked to see if the number is prime.
